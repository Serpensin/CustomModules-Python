Throughout history, humanity has often underestimated the pace of technological progress,
believing that the limits of innovation had already been reached,
only to be surprised by breakthroughs that completely reshaped daily life.

Today, the smartphone in your pocket combines the power of a supercomputer
with the convenience of instant global communication,
yet many take this achievement for granted,
rarely considering the decades of research and experimentation that made it possible.

However, with every advance comes responsibility,
and society must decide whether new tools will be used to reduce inequality,
fight climate change, and expand knowledgeâ€”
or whether they will instead deepen existing problems.

Ultimately, technology itself is neutral;
it is neither savior nor villain,
but rather a reflection of the values, priorities,
and choices of the people who wield it.
